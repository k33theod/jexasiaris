A planner that allows you to open a file, open a webpage, open a simple window message or send an email in a specified time.
How it works
a. Set the time string to the time moment you wish. Do not change the time format. 
b. Get 1 of the options cliking on the button. Select file, write url, write message or fill the form required to send email.
Thats all. To get the message on time the programm should be running.
Old tasks are not removed aytomatically. You should remove them by clickin on the right-bottom-button on main programm window, otherwise you take all messages each time you run the programm.
First time you use the programm it creates extra files required to save the tasks and may not be able to get a running task. 
Email may require to change your settings in your email server client.
